## :wave: Intros!

Simon Game is a gaming web app that challenges your brain memory and features a 70s retro style and audio effects. The functionalities of the game is built upon a mixture of vanilla JS and jQuery.

## :game: How To Play

1. To start the game, press any key on the keyboard to initialize.

2. The game will start off by randomly selecting a color button. This can be identified by the flash effect.

3. As the player starting off initially at level 1, you will have to select the same color button that the program had randomly selected.

4. After the player selected the button that matches the program selected button, the program will move on to the next level and randomly selects another button.

5. At each subsequent level, the player will have to build on their brain memory to select all the previously selected buttons in the correct order along with the correct button at the current level.

6. If the user selects any wrong button that doesn't match the game pattern color sequence, the game will be over and the game level will reset to the beginning.

7. To start a new game again, repeat Step 1.
